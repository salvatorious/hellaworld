4. `vagrant box add laravel/homestead`
5. `cd ~`
6. `git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git Homestead`
7. `cd Homestead`
8. `git checkout v6.1.0`
9. (**current pwd:** ~/Homestead) `bash init.sh`
10. `vim Homestead.yaml`  
   ![Sal's homestead.yaml](http://nicetouch.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/homestead-config.png)  
11. `mkdir ~/Code/Laravel/public`
12. `echo "192.168.10.10  homestead.app" >> /etc/hosts`
13. `vagrant reload --provision` 
14. If you get a 403 forbidden error when attempting to visit http://homestead.app: `sudo chown -R _www ~/Code/Laravel ; sudo chmod -R g+w ~/Code/Laravel`

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
